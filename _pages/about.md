I am a Ph.D. student in political science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am broadly interested in political communication, information and communications technology (ICT), and public opinion in authoritarian regimes. My current project explores the effect of political censorship in autocracies with experiments. I am originally from China.
