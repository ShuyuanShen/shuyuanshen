I am a Ph.D. student in political science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am broadly interested in political communication, information and communications technology (ICT), and public opinion in authoritarian regimes. My current project explores the effect of propaganda and censorship in autocracies with computational and experimental methods. I am originally from China.
